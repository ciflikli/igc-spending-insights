UK government departments publish monthly datasets listing all payments to suppliers over £25,000. These data are meant to improve transparency, but in practice they are messy, inconsistent, and difficult for policymakers to use to spot inefficiencies, duplicate spending, or procurement risks. The Cabinet Office wants to pilot an AI-assisted “Spending Insights Tool” that helps analysts automatically classify and interpret these transactions. Develop a prototype that uses open “Spend over £25,000” data from selected UK government departments below to demonstrate how AI can turn raw transaction records into actionable policy insights. The system should (1) ingest and standardise transaction-level spending data across departments. (2) Classify payments by type of expenditure (e.g. IT, consultancy, construction, travel) using text descriptions and supplier information. (3) Highlight anomalies or inefficiencies in spending patterns, such as unusually high payments, repeated transactions, supplier concentration, or concerning temporal trends. (4) Use a language model-based method to generate concise analytical summaries that communicate key spending trends and potential risks to policymakers in plain language.
